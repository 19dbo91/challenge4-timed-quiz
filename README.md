# Challenge #4: Timed Quiz

## Description

The objective of this project is to present a quiz web app to prepare someone before their exam.
I wanted to create this site in part as practice for my understanding fundamentals in frontend developing, as well as provide template for self-testing/refresher material.

Lessons Learned:
There were probably ways to create more concise and succinct functions. Due to limitation on time, I am more prone to side with code that is faster for me create/read/understand and run.

Bugs are always inherent in the process. Give yourself enough time to think and create a plan to solve.
