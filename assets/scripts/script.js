USR STORY
_______________________________________________________________________________
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers



ACC CRIT
_______________________________________________________________________________
.:  I am taking a code quiz

@ click the start button:
    THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

@ answer a question:
    THEN I am presented with another question

@ answer a question incorrectly:
    THEN time is subtracted from the clock

@ all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0:
    THEN the game is over

@ the game is over:
    THEN I can save my initials and my score



NOTES ON MOCK UP
_______________________________________________________________________________

format tends to be fill-in the blank questions

after click: instant feedback -> correct/wrong, shortly after disappears

visible top lt: view high scores at any time
visible top rt: time (starts at 75s... wrong -6s)

on game over "page" -> form to give initials and score to board
on hi-score "page" -> goback takes you to start "page"
on start "page" -> go -> question page
on question page -> options(4) -> next question -until out of questions/time-> 

options are in ordered list and styled
